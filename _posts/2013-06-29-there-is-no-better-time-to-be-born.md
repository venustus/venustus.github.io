Until most recently, I was not so optimistic. The situation seemed grave and hopeless. There is war, hunger, poverty,
corruption, disease among countless other things that we all hate. On the fifth day after you were born, thousands 
of people have died of flash floods hardly a thousand kilometers away. On a planet that already seems saturated with 
people, in a time when the earth looks worst of all times, it hardly seems a good time to arrive.

If you were born just 200 years earlier, it would have been so different. You’d probably not have as much comfort, 
but you’ll probably have lived much more peaceful life (Provided you had lived through first few years). 
You’d have lot less to learn and a lot more time to kill. You’d have been more attached to people around you than to 
things on you (or inside you). You’d tread on greener pastures and breathe cleaner air. Sure there won’t be TV or 
Telephone or Internet, but your life would have been less eventful. But a peaceful life does not automatically 
mean the best.

After observing how this world works for more than a few years, I had come to believe that this is a golden age to be 
born. Sure there are immaculate challenges for humanity, but equally astounding opportunities. 
This is an era of creators and innovators. This generation created the Internet. Your grand-grand children will talk 
about this time. They’ll remember that few people searched for truth and beauty and changed the course of the world. 
They’ll talk about the advent of scientific thought and about how a civilization consisting of only farmers and 
nomads had turned into one bubbling with inventors and explorers.

This time is also the most dynamic of all history. By the time you are old enough to understand the world, 
it may not longer be the same. But the good part is, it is going to be your choice. You’ve more power now than ever 
to change things for good. You’ve more problems than ever, to seek solutions for. You won’t be solving all the 
world’s problems. You can’t. But you have a chance to become a part of a beautiful mosaic. You can participate 
in one of the biggest silent revolutions in human history - I call the Truth revolution. Some call it the revolution 
of love. Some call it the scientific revolution. But this is all about seeking the truth, together. People would 
eventually realize, there are too many things in this world that distract us from seeing what we really want, 
what we really enjoy doing. More and more people would soon join the Truth revolution.You won’t be alone on your 
journey.

Regardless of what your choices are, remember that I always love you unconditionally. Because you are more than your 
choices and deeds (just like every one else is).
