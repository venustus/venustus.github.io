Ever since I started following <a href="http://paulgraham.com/articles.html">Paul Grahams' blog</a>, I have been a big fan of his writings, especially on start ups and technology. I regard him as one of the few contemporary true technologists in existence today.<br /><br />But he brings out all those killer instincts of a programmer eloquently in this book. He starts of with defining the term 'Hackers' in his own way. Being brought up in India, it is hard to convince anyone that programming is an art, much like painting, that needs practice and skills are acquired over time. In this book, he explains this point with unbelievable persuasion and anybody reading it would come out with a refined perspective about the profession.<br /><br />He then goes on to talk about a 100 year old programming language and why we should choose our tools wisely in order to create beautiful software. He also talks about why start ups are inherently a better work environment for technologically hungry programmers. Although I don't think you must be necessarily in a start up to do work that matters, I find his arguments compelling. After reading this book, I decided I would always look forward to working with a small team of passionate people even if we are part of a bigger organization.<br /><br />He demonstrates wit and intelligence in every paragraph and the essays are thought provoking. At the end of it, they'll leave you as a better programmers.<br /><br />And yes, saying that he is a Lisp enthusiast would be an understatement. The book is available on Amazon.<br /><br /><br /> <iframe src="http://rcm-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/cm?t=venustus-20&o=1&p=8&l=as1&asins=1449389554&ref=tf_til&fc1=000000&IS2=1&lt1=_blank&m=amazon&lc1=0000FF&bc1=000000&bg1=FFFFFF&f=ifr" style="width:120px;height:240px;" scrolling="no" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" frameborder="0"></iframe>  </div></div> <!-- Start of Amazon Publisher Studio Loader -->    <script>  window.amznpubstudioTag = "harrypott09df-20";  </script>    <!-- Do not modify the following code ! -->  <script async="true" type="text/javascript" src="http://ps-us.amazon-adsystem.com/domains/harrypott09df-20_73f82334-2f63-4399-848a-4157fb20cf76.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>    <!-- End of Amazon Publisher Studio Loader -->
