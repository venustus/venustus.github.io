Lately, I have been realizing that I'm changing my editor font too many times. It is almost as if I'm obsessed about fonts. 
Somehow without a proper font, I feel that the ideas (and code) are not flowing as smoothly as they should.
Particularly, after I started using a Mac since a few years back, where fonts look much more beautiful, I got 
so addicted to the beautiful fonts that I bought a [typekit subscription](https://typekit.com/fonts).
Over time, I've tried variety of programming fonts and I would like to share my experiences with a bunch of them.

Fixed with fonts
----------------

If you are fiddling with fonts on your editor or command line, first thing to keep in mind is that you must
stick to monospace or fixed width fonts. Monospace fonts are those in which every character has exactly the same width on screen.
Without a monospace font, whole indentation is screwed up and it results in terrible loss in productivity.

Installing fonts under MAC OS X
-------------------------------

Most of the free fonts are available for download as files with TTF or OTF extension. To install those fonts, just 
download them to somewhere on your disk, and open the files by double clicking them. They open by default using
<em>Font Book</em> application. There shall be a button called <em>Install Font</em> in this application. Click
it and you are done.

If you have a typekit subscription, then you just need to sync fonts using Adobe Creative Cloud helper application 
and there is no separate download needed.


Anonymous Pro
-------------

The first non-standard font I tried and almost fell in love with was [Anonymous Pro](http://www.marksimonson.com/fonts/view/anonymous-pro).
This font is developed by Mark Simonson and is available free of charge for download from the 
[website](http://www.marksimonson.com/fonts/view/anonymous-pro) under Open Font License 
and also from almost all the font foundries.
 
Here is how it looks:

It is pleasant on the eye and is available in all four variants - regular, italic, bold and bold italic.

Source Code Pro
---------------

This is a programming font from Adobe that is closer to a sans-serif font than Anonymous Pro. It is very 
<em>round</em> and works better on low resolution displays. At 13 points, it also looks sharper and thicker than
Anonymous Pro. This is also available under Open Font License and you can download it from 
[here](https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-code-pro/releases/tag/1.017R). 
If I were to switch to a sans-serif font, this would be my first preference.

Envy Code R
-----------

This has a particularly legacy feel to it and reminds you of those old terminals. Although it is not 
particularly pleasant on eyes, it is surprisingly legible and packs more characters in the same space.
Designed by Damien Guard, this is also available for free download from [here](https://download.damieng.com/fonts/original/EnvyCodeR-PR7.zip).
Here is a screen shot of the same:

Fira Mono
-----------

While this font looks very close to Source Code Pro and is in a sans serif family to be precise, there are 
slight and unmistakable serifs around the letters that give it the missing traditional look. 
I feel that this strikes the right balance between modern and traditional 
fonts. Some letters like 'g' and 'J' look extremely elegant. The basic version is produced by Mozilla 
and is used in Firefox OS. You can see more information about it [here](https://mozilla.github.io/Fira/).
