Evolution is one of the oldest scientific discoveries that human kind has produced. But in my opinion, it is also the
most successful scientific theory, if you measure success of a theory by how long it withstood the test of time. Not even 
relativity has beaten it's record yet. Over past few hundred years, there were thousands of artifacts, experiments and a lot of 
empirical evidence that supports this theory. But at the same time, there also were thousands of people working tirelessly 
for hundreds of years, looking for loop holes in the theory or some new fossil or some new experiment which could disprove 
evolution. However, there has not been a single peer reviewed experiment or evidence till date, that contradicts the theory of evolution.

Despite it's apparent success and overwhelming evidence, I found it surprising that many people, even well-educated ones, find it hard to accept
evolution. In this article, I will attempt to present a case for evolution and and answer some of the frequently asked questions in
this context. I'm not a natural biologist or archeologist, so this article is not scientific at all and is not a replacement to
massive evidence that has piled up over hundreds of years. But a genuinely interested reader can go look for it and I'm 
sure you'll find it.

Scientific Theory
=================

Before discussing evolution itself, I'd like to stress on one important aspect of what constitutes a scientific theory. 
A scientific theory is open for anybody to verify. And any scientist (sane ones anyway) shall be open to new
discoveries and hence the theory keeps getting updated constantly with new findings. You see, by stating a theory, we are 
not stating facts. We are merely stating our understanding of the reality and claiming that this is most logical and the 
best explanation of how things work, based on the current empirical evidence. For instance, <i>Sun rises in the east</i> is
a fact. On the other hand, <i>Sun appears to rise in the east because earth is rotating from west to east</i> is a theory.

A theory starts as a simple proposal about how things work and most often accompanied by evidence supporting the proposal.
Then more people review the evidence presented and try to repeat the experiments done by the original presenter. The 
experiments attempt to compare results from real world, with the values from predictions from the proposal. If the
results of the experiments conducted by different people consistently match the predictions of the proposal, it starts to gain more confidence
in the community and after certain stage, it gets accepted as a theory.
 
Note that most important part of proposing a theory is to come up with experiments that can be repeated any number of times
and can be verified by anybody. This means, nobody needs to take the presenters' words for granted. One can independently 
verify that everything predicted by the theory matches with the real world.

A scientific view is the most conservative view you can take. You have the right to question everything and you may attempt
to break the proposal in all kinds of ways. But if the proposal doesn't yield and comes out with winning predictions all 
the time, you then accept that it as the most logical explanation of the phenomenon.

Theory of evolution
===================

The theory goes like this. It all started with single celled organisms which are considered most primitive form of life. 
As of now, it appears they are formed from hot water soups back in the old days by a series of chemical reactions. I think
the most appropriate word to use here is <i>Accident</i>. That is what life is - it is an accident. To be fair,
original theory of evolution as proposed by Charles Darwin, <i>assumed</i> the fact that life originated somehow and did not 
explain how it did. In fact, you need not accept this fact to get convinced about evolution, although it does sound pretty logical to me.
There are lots of chemicals on earth and they could interact with each other in all kinds of weird ways. 

Deep inside the first single-cell organisms, is this tiny strand of DNA that influenced how different chemical reactions
proceeded in the cell and hence driving the behavior of that cell. When the cells reproduce (which is again a consequence of chemical
reactions happening in the cell), they pass on some of the DNA to their children. However, the process of passing on the DNA
is not perfect. So, mistakes happen and small changes happen in the DNA sequence as they get passed to offspring. These 
small changes in DNA when being passed to offspring are called <i>mutations</i>. This is the first critical part of the theory.

Without mutations, there will be no change in DNA sequence of any organism and hence life would have been stuck in the single-cell
phase and has no room to improve. 

The mutated DNA eventually influences some behavior of the living organism - because eventually everything is influenced by DNA. 
Some behaviors tend to be help the survival of the organism, while some others adversely affect it's survival. For example, 
for a single celled organism, staying in the middle of the pack where it is warm, could be vital while those who stray towards 
the edges die faster because of the cold.

The second important ingredient is about how genes survive through the survival of the organism itself. You see, when an organism
survives because of the behavior caused by it's genes, it is more likely to reproduce and hence it is more likely to pass on the
genes to it's descendants. So, genes which cause behaviors favorable to survival, tend to stick around in the offspring
simply because, those with other kind of genes did not live long enough to bear offspring. This process is called <i>natural selection</i>
and is the second important cog in the wheel.

In this way, more complex life forms <i>evolved</i> from simple life forms via numerous successive and small changes in their 
DNA structure. Because the mutation is random - that is any particular gene could be missing in offspring or a particular
gene could be duplicated or flipped, there is no determinism in this process. There are several paths organisms
can take through the evolutionary tree. This randomness gives birth to complexity and variety and ultimately resulted in
the most astonishingly complex life forms we see today.

While the theory itself is quite elegant, it offends common sense to lot of people. They see all this complexity
and wonder that this could not have been formed all by itself. While I share the awe, people do not realize about one important
ingredient evolution had at it's disposal to make this all possible - Time. Earth formed approximately 4.6 billion years ago
and first life forms originated around 3.4 billion years ago. 3.4 billion years is a long long time. It was long enough
for evolution to work slowly, but methodically. As successive generations of organisms emerged, more and more random mutations
in genome started happening and members of a species started being more different from each other. This continued until at some point,
the members are so different from each other that they no longer can be called same species.

Now let me answer some questions that an astute non-believer might have:

Frequently Asked Questions
==========================

* How do you explain the gap between age of fossils we are finding? There must be some miracle that turned one species into a 
completely different one.

This is a common question among diligent enthusiasts who are going through the evidence in the hope of convincing themselves. When we find a
fossil that is, let us say, x years ago and we do not find any fossils that are dated any time between x and x + a million years, 
it occurs, perhaps that gap is where some mysterious super natural force tended to earth and changed the course. 

But this is a very vulnerable position to be in, in an argument. Because these gaps are closing fast. There are no longer as many gaps as 
existed a hundred years ago and we are constantly finding more and more fossils. It is simply more logical to assume that we have not 
been able to find any fossil for the gap yet, than to assume that some super natural force was involved. One may argue that both these
are assumptions and why the former assumption is superior to the latter. But they are not assumptions of same kind. In the first
assumption, there are no more questions to answer, no more justifications to give. We just have to go look for more fossils to fill
in the gaps. But in the second stand, we have to now ask what is this external super natural force like? Where is this originating
from? How does it change something that is happening on earth? How this force was created in the first place? 

You see, we are going down a rabbit's hole. No matter what answer one may give to the above questions, no one can prove 
whether they are right or wrong. They would ask you to take matter in faith and take their words for granted as if they have some
authority over what is right/wrong. This is exactly what science does not do. 

Going with the first assumption, a sane person can now sleep in peace, comfortable in the fact that we have a logical explanation
about how reality works and we'll work on expanding our knowledge further. 

* Some complex piece of machinery like 'the human eye' seems so magical. It could not have been formed by itself. It looks like
a master's design.

The human eye is a true marvel. Despite being just about 2 centimeters in diameter, human eye has over 2 million moving parts,
all working together to provide us one of the sharpest and broadest visions in the animal kingdom. It seems impossible that
such a complex organ could have been formed via numerous but minute successive mutations. 

The main problem here is what is referred to as irreducible complexity. If you take out any one of the 2 million parts,
the eye would not function the way it should be. So, how can the eye develop it's parts in stages?

The trick many of us fall prey to, when listening to such argument, is that we confuse parts of an organ with features they 
deliver. For example, consider an animal which has eyes almost exactly same as those of humans, but it does not have cones
which means it cannot detect color. Lack of ability to detect color does impact survivability of the animal, if only very slightly.
It is easier to distinguish between a predator and a harmless animal when viewing in color. It could help distinguish 
between a fruit that is ripe vs. the one that is not. It could allow an animal to detect changes in skin color of mates, 
when they are emotionally excited. All of these characteristics promote survivability and reproducing capacity of the animal
and hence the corresponding genes which produce cones when forming the eye would be passed on through generations till a full
color vision emerges.

At some point, there must have been a random mutation that caused one or two cones to be present in the eye, but from then on,
the natural selection takes over and makes sure these genes are rewarded and passed on through further generations.

Similarly, a blurred vision is much better than no vision at all. So, any random mutation that causes even slightest amount of
improvements in vision will be rewarded hugely as they improve survivability of the animal significantly.

* But many seemingly wise people have taught us from the child hood that life was created by a master designer. 

Well, for generations, certain sections of society have tried to gain control over the rest of the society in the interest
of material gains. Humans are very vulnerable to authority. Many of us are ingrained from the child hood to take these
preachings for granted without questioning them. If people believe that a master designer was involved, then those who claim
to be representatives of this master designer suddenly become very important and significant although they do not have any
expertise or credentials in the said field. They did not conduct any experiments nor did they try to disprove evolution 
by showing evidence. They are asking you to blindly believe in what they say. 

It is time to question yourself about what you want to believe and it is entirely up to you.
